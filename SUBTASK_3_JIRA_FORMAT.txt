SUB-TASK 3: DEVELOP FRONTEND STYLE LIBRARY FOR REUSE
================================================================================

Epic: Frontend Visualization Standardization v1.0.0
Department: CBO
Date Created: October 25, 2025
Assignee: [TO BE ASSIGNED]
Status: To Do

================================================================================
TASK DESCRIPTION
================================================================================

OBJECTIVE:
Develop a reusable frontend style library that implements the standards 
defined in Sub-Tasks 1 and 2, providing ready-to-use components, styles, 
and utilities for CBO Department dashboard projects.

BACKGROUND:
With framework structure (Sub-Task 1) and visualization standards (Sub-Task 2) 
established, we need to create a practical, reusable library that developers 
can immediately use in their projects. This library will be the single source 
of truth for all styling, components, and utilities.

SCOPE:
This task covers:
- Component library (reusable React components)
- Style utilities (CSS/SCSS helpers and mixins)
- JavaScript utilities (formatting, validation, helpers)
- Documentation and usage examples
- Package structure and distribution

Out of Scope:
- Integration with specific external systems (Sub-Task 4)
- Project-specific business logic
- Backend or API implementations

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
1. Component library created with all standard components
2. Style utilities package created
3. JavaScript helper library created
4. Comprehensive documentation with examples
5. Library installable via npm/package manager
6. Successfully tested in at least 2 pilot projects
7. Reviewed and approved by minimum 2 team members

DEFINITION OF DONE:
- All standard components implemented and tested
- Style utilities documented and working
- JavaScript helpers documented with unit tests
- README and API documentation complete
- Package published to internal registry
- Usage examples and starter templates provided
- Reviewed by 2 senior developers
- Approved by Tech Lead

================================================================================
PLANNING SUMMARY
================================================================================

APPROACH:

Phase 1: Library Setup
- Initialize monorepo structure (e.g., using Lerna, Nx, or Turborepo)
- Setup build system (TypeScript, Webpack/Vite)
- Configure testing framework (Jest, React Testing Library)
- Setup documentation system (Storybook or similar)
- Configure CI/CD pipeline

Phase 2: Component Development
- Implement Layout components (Layout, Frame, Header, Sidebar, SubHeader)
- Implement KPI Card components (StatCard, ComparisonStatCard, etc.)
- Implement Chart components (LineChart, BarChart, DonutChart, etc.)
- Implement Slicer components (YearSlicer, MonthSlicer, etc.)
- Implement Modal components (detail popups, zoom modals)
- Implement Utility components (AccessControl, Loading, etc.)

Phase 3: Style Utilities
- Create CSS utility classes
- Develop SCSS mixins and functions
- Implement theming system
- Create responsive breakpoint utilities
- Package global styles

Phase 4: JavaScript Utilities
- Implement format helpers (currency, number, date)
- Create validation utilities
- Develop calculation helpers
- Implement data transformation utilities
- Create API client helpers

Phase 5: Documentation & Testing
- Write component documentation
- Create usage examples
- Write unit tests (target 70%+ coverage)
- Create integration test examples
- Build starter template projects

RESOURCES NEEDED:
- Development environment setup
- Access to reference implementations
- Package registry (npm/internal)
- CI/CD infrastructure
- Design assets (icons, logos)
- Testing accounts/environments
- Approval from 2 senior developers

DELIVERABLES:
1. @cbo/component-library package containing:
   - All standard React components
   - TypeScript type definitions
   - Component documentation

2. @cbo/style-utilities package containing:
   - Global CSS styles
   - SCSS mixins and functions
   - Theme configuration
   - Utility classes

3. @cbo/utils package containing:
   - Format helpers
   - Validation utilities
   - Calculation helpers
   - Data transformation utilities

4. Documentation:
   - README for each package
   - API reference documentation
   - Usage examples and guides
   - Storybook or component playground
   - Migration guide from previous patterns

5. Starter templates:
   - Basic dashboard template
   - Advanced dashboard template
   - Example project with all components

DEPENDENCIES:
- Sub-Task 1 completed (framework standards)
- Sub-Task 2 completed (visualization standards)
- Package registry access
- CI/CD infrastructure available

RISKS & MITIGATION:

Risk 1: Library becomes too opinionated, limiting flexibility
Mitigation: Design for extensibility, provide composition patterns, 
document customization options

Risk 2: Breaking changes in dependencies (React, chart libraries)
Mitigation: Use stable versions, implement comprehensive tests, 
maintain changelog

Risk 3: Adoption resistance from developers
Mitigation: Provide excellent documentation, create examples, 
offer migration support

Risk 4: Maintenance burden too high
Mitigation: Assign dedicated maintainers, establish contribution 
guidelines, automate testing
