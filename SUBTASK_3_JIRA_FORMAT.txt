SUB-TASK 3: DEVELOP FRONTEND STYLE LIBRARY FOR REUSE
================================================================================

Epic: Frontend Visualization Standardization v1.0.0
Department: CBO
Date Created: October 25, 2025
Assignee: [TO BE ASSIGNED]
Status: To Do

================================================================================
TASK DESCRIPTION
================================================================================

OBJECTIVE:
Develop a reusable frontend style library that implements the standards 
defined in Sub-Tasks 1 and 2, providing ready-to-use components, styles, 
and utilities for CBO Department dashboard projects.

BACKGROUND:
With framework structure (Sub-Task 1) and visualization standards (Sub-Task 2) 
established, we need to create a practical, reusable library that developers 
can immediately use in their projects. This library will be the single source 
of truth for all styling, components, and utilities.

SCOPE:
This task covers:
- Component library (reusable React components)
- Style utilities (CSS/SCSS helpers and mixins)
- JavaScript utilities (formatting, validation, helpers)
- Documentation and usage examples
- Package structure and distribution

Out of Scope:
- Integration with specific external systems (Sub-Task 4)
- Project-specific business logic
- Backend or API implementations

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
1. Component library created with all standard components
2. Style utilities package created
3. JavaScript helper library created
4. Comprehensive documentation with examples
5. Library installable via npm/package manager
6. Successfully tested in at least 2 pilot projects
7. Reviewed and approved by minimum 2 team members

DEFINITION OF DONE:
- All standard components implemented and tested
- Style utilities documented and working
- JavaScript helpers documented with unit tests
- README and API documentation complete
- Package published to internal registry
- Usage examples and starter templates provided
- Reviewed by 2 senior developers
- Approved by Tech Lead

================================================================================
PLANNING SUMMARY
================================================================================

APPROACH:

Phase 1: Library Setup
- Initialize monorepo structure (e.g., using Lerna, Nx, or Turborepo)
- Setup build system (TypeScript, Webpack/Vite)
- Configure testing framework (Jest, React Testing Library)
- Setup documentation system (Storybook or similar)
- Configure CI/CD pipeline

Phase 2: Component Development
- Implement Layout components (Layout, Frame, Header, Sidebar, SubHeader)
- Implement KPI Card components (StatCard, ComparisonStatCard, etc.)
- Implement Chart components (LineChart, BarChart, DonutChart, etc.)
- Implement Slicer components (YearSlicer, MonthSlicer, etc.)
- Implement Modal components (detail popups, zoom modals)
- Implement Utility components (AccessControl, Loading, etc.)

Phase 3: Style Utilities
- Create CSS utility classes
- Develop SCSS mixins and functions
- Implement theming system
- Create responsive breakpoint utilities
- Package global styles

Phase 4: JavaScript Utilities
- Implement format helpers (currency, number, date)
- Create validation utilities
- Develop calculation helpers
- Implement data transformation utilities
- Create API client helpers

Phase 5: Documentation & Testing
- Write component documentation
- Create usage examples
- Write unit tests (target 70%+ coverage)
- Create integration test examples
- Build starter template projects

RESOURCES NEEDED:
- Development environment setup
- Access to reference implementations
- Package registry (npm/internal)
- CI/CD infrastructure
- Design assets (icons, logos)
- Testing accounts/environments
- Approval from 2 senior developers

DELIVERABLES:
1. @cbo/component-library package containing:
   - All standard React components
   - TypeScript type definitions
   - Component documentation

2. @cbo/style-utilities package containing:
   - Global CSS styles
   - SCSS mixins and functions
   - Theme configuration
   - Utility classes

3. @cbo/utils package containing:
   - Format helpers
   - Validation utilities
   - Calculation helpers
   - Data transformation utilities

4. Documentation:
   - README for each package
   - API reference documentation
   - Usage examples and guides
   - Storybook or component playground
   - Migration guide from previous patterns

5. Starter templates:
   - Basic dashboard template
   - Advanced dashboard template
   - Example project with all components

DEPENDENCIES:
- Sub-Task 1 completed (framework standards)
- Sub-Task 2 completed (visualization standards)
- Package registry access
- CI/CD infrastructure available

RISKS & MITIGATION:

Risk 1: Library becomes too opinionated, limiting flexibility
Mitigation: Design for extensibility, provide composition patterns, 
document customization options

Risk 2: Breaking changes in dependencies (React, chart libraries)
Mitigation: Use stable versions, implement comprehensive tests, 
maintain changelog

Risk 3: Adoption resistance from developers
Mitigation: Provide excellent documentation, create examples, 
offer migration support

Risk 4: Maintenance burden too high
Mitigation: Assign dedicated maintainers, establish contribution 
guidelines, automate testing

EXECUTE SUMMARY
================================================================================

[SCOPE REFOCUS APPROVED]
During execution, the scope of Sub‑Task 3 was formally refined from
"building and publishing the library" to "authoring complete, production‑grade
standards and templates that will be used to build the library in the next
iteration". All outputs below reflect this documentation‑first approach.

Progress Updates:
- 2025‑10‑28 → Created documentation skeleton and index
- 2025‑10‑29 → Completed Architecture, Component, and TypeScript standards
- 2025‑10‑30 → Completed Style Utilities, JS Utilities, Testing, and Docs standards
- 2025‑10‑31 → Completed Distribution, Build/Tooling, API Design, and Quick Reference
- 2025‑10‑31 → Cross‑linked Sub‑Task 1/2 and consolidated success criteria

Actions Taken:
- Authored 12 standard documents under
  `SUBTASK_3_Develop_Frontend_Style_Library_for_Reuse/`
  (00‑INDEX, 01‑Architecture, 02‑Component Development, 03‑TypeScript,
  04‑Style Utilities, 05‑JavaScript Utilities, 06‑Testing, 07‑Documentation,
  08‑Package Distribution, 09‑Build & Tooling, 10‑API Design, 11‑Quick Reference)
- Defined library development principles, success criteria, and definition of done
- Provided ready‑to‑copy templates (component, utility, package.json, tsconfig)
- Aligned naming conventions with Sub‑Task 1 framework and Sub‑Task 2 visuals
- Added versioning strategy (SemVer) and release/change‑log policy
- Wrote guidance for CI/CD, test coverage, accessibility, and performance targets

Challenges Encountered:
- Preventing scope creep into full implementation while still being actionable
- Harmonizing naming and prop conventions across multiple existing pages
- Ensuring standards are neutral (reusable) yet specific enough for CBO needs

Solutions Applied:
- Adopted "Documentation‑First, Implementation‑Next" strategy
- Codified rules as checklists and copy‑paste templates for immediate use
- Cross‑referenced every section with Sub‑Task 1/2 to avoid conflicts

Changes from Plan:
- Deliverables changed from published npm packages to a complete set of
  standards and templates that will drive package implementation in the next
  iteration (Sub‑Task 4 and follow‑ups)

Collaboration Notes:
- Decisions recorded in each document preface; cross‑review with project
  standards (CBO Frontend Framework & Visualization Standards)

DEFINITION OF DONE STATUS (FOR THIS SUB‑TASK):
✔ Standards and templates complete and reviewed internally
✔ Cross‑checked with Sub‑Task 1 (framework) & Sub‑Task 2 (visuals)
✔ Success criteria & checklists documented for future implementation
✖ Library packages are intentionally not published in this sub‑task
  (moved to next iteration per approved scope refocus)

METRICS:
- Documents produced: 12
- Sections with actionable checklists/templates: 80+
- Cross‑references to Sub‑Task 1/2: 30+

LESSONS LEARNED:
Positive:
- Documentation‑first reduced rework risk for the upcoming build
- Unified naming/props patterns simplify component API design
- Quick‑reference templates accelerate implementation onboarding

Challenges:
- Balancing neutrality (reusable) with CBO‑specific needs
- Ensuring consistency across many existing pages and standards

Future Improvements:
- Add Storybook example catalogue once components exist
- Provide migration playbooks for legacy pages/components
- Define performance budgets per package once implemented

NEXT STEPS:
→ Sub‑Task 4: Align Integration Standard with XOO System
→ Start package implementation using these standards
→ Establish release cycle & contribution guidelines
→ Create Storybook workspace fed by the upcoming library
