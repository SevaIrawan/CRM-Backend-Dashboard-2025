SUB-TASK 4: ALIGN INTEGRATION STANDARD WITH XOO SYSTEM
================================================================================

Epic: Frontend Visualization Standardization v1.0.0
Department: CBO
Date Created: October 25, 2025
Assignee: [TO BE ASSIGNED]
Status: To Do

================================================================================
TASK DESCRIPTION
================================================================================

OBJECTIVE:
Establish standardized integration patterns and communication protocols between 
CBO Department dashboard applications and XOO Department (IT & AI) systems to 
ensure seamless collaboration and data exchange.

BACKGROUND:
XOO Department (IT & AI) develops and maintains various systems and tools that 
need to integrate with CBO dashboards. To ensure smooth integration and reduce 
integration complexity, we need to establish clear standards for API 
communication, authentication, data formats, and error handling that both 
departments can follow.

SCOPE:
This task covers:
- API communication patterns and standards
- Authentication and authorization protocols
- Data exchange formats and schemas
- Error handling and logging conventions
- Integration testing guidelines
- Documentation for both departments

Out of Scope:
- Implementation of XOO systems (owned by XOO)
- Specific business logic (project-specific)
- Infrastructure setup (owned by DevOps)

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
1. Integration standards document created and approved
2. API contract specifications defined
3. Authentication flow documented
4. Data format schemas established
5. Error handling patterns standardized
6. XOO Department reviewed and approved standards
7. At least 1 successful pilot integration completed

DEFINITION OF DONE:
- Integration standards document completed
- API contract templates created
- Authentication flow diagram and implementation guide
- Data schema definitions with examples
- Error codes and handling documented
- Reviewed by CBO Tech Lead
- Reviewed and approved by XOO Department representative
- Pilot integration tested successfully

================================================================================
PLANNING SUMMARY
================================================================================

APPROACH:

Phase 1: Requirement Gathering
- Meet with XOO Department to understand their systems
- Document current integration patterns (if any)
- Identify pain points in existing integrations
- Gather technical requirements from both sides
- Define integration use cases

Phase 2: Define Standards
- API communication standards (REST/GraphQL/WebSocket)
- Authentication protocols (OAuth2, JWT, API keys)
- Data format specifications (JSON schemas)
- Request/response patterns
- Rate limiting and throttling rules
- Error codes and messages
- Versioning strategy

Phase 3: Create Documentation
- Write integration standards document
- Create API contract templates
- Document authentication flows
- Provide data schema examples
- Write integration testing guide
- Create troubleshooting guide

Phase 4: Pilot Implementation
- Select pilot integration project
- Implement using new standards
- Test end-to-end flows
- Gather feedback from both teams
- Refine standards based on learnings

RESOURCES NEEDED:
- Access to XOO Department documentation
- Meeting time with XOO representatives
- Test environments for integration testing
- API testing tools (Postman, Insomnia)
- Documentation platform (Confluence)
- Approval from CBO Tech Lead
- Approval from XOO Department Lead

DELIVERABLES:
1. CBO_XOO_INTEGRATION_STANDARDS.md document containing:
   - API communication standards
   - Authentication and authorization guide
   - Data format specifications
   - Request/response patterns
   - Error handling conventions
   - Versioning strategy
   - Best practices

2. API Contract Templates:
   - OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
   - Request/response examples
   - Error response formats
   - Authentication examples

3. Integration Guides:
   - Getting Started guide for developers
   - Authentication setup guide
   - Common integration patterns
   - Troubleshooting guide

4. Pilot Integration:
   - Working integration example
   - Integration test suite
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Lessons learned document

DEPENDENCIES:
- Sub-Task 1, 2, 3 completed (framework ready)
- XOO Department availability for collaboration
- Test environments accessible
- No blocking infrastructure issues

RISKS & MITIGATION:

Risk 1: XOO Department unavailable or unresponsive
Mitigation: Schedule meetings early, escalate to management if needed, 
document standards based on best practices as baseline

Risk 2: XOO systems not compatible with proposed standards
Mitigation: Design flexible standards, provide multiple integration 
options, find middle ground through negotiation

Risk 3: Security requirements conflict with ease of use
Mitigation: Prioritize security, provide clear examples and tooling 
to simplify secure integration

Risk 4: Standards become outdated quickly
Mitigation: Include versioning strategy, plan regular review cycles, 
establish change management process
