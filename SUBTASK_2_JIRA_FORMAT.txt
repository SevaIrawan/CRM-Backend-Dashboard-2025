SUB-TASK 2: STANDARDIZE VISUALIZATION ELEMENTS
================================================================================

Epic: Frontend Visualization Standardization v1.0.0
Department: CBO
Date Created: October 25, 2025
Assignee: [TO BE ASSIGNED]
Status: To Do

================================================================================
TASK DESCRIPTION
================================================================================

OBJECTIVE:
Establish standardized visualization elements including charts, fonts, and 
layout systems to ensure consistency across all CBO Department dashboard 
applications.

BACKGROUND:
Following the establishment of framework and component rules (Sub-Task 1), 
we need to define standards for visual elements to ensure all dashboards 
have consistent look and feel. This includes chart types, typography system, 
color palettes, spacing rules, and responsive behavior.

SCOPE:
This task covers:
- Chart standards (types, configurations, colors, interactions)
- Typography system (fonts, sizes, weights, hierarchy)
- Layout standards (spacing, grids, responsive breakpoints)
- Color palette (primary, secondary, status colors)
- Visual consistency guidelines

Out of Scope:
- Component implementation (covered in Sub-Task 3)
- Integration patterns (covered in Sub-Task 4)
- Business logic and data processing

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
1. Chart standards documented for all chart types
2. Typography system fully defined with examples
3. Layout standards including spacing and grid rules
4. Color palette established with usage guidelines
5. Responsive design standards documented
6. Reviewed and approved by minimum 2 team members

DEFINITION OF DONE:
- Comprehensive visualization standards document created
- Chart configuration examples provided for each type
- Typography specimens and usage guidelines included
- Layout examples with code snippets
- Color palette with hex codes and usage rules
- Reviewed by 2 senior developers
- Approved by Tech Lead and Design Lead (if applicable)

================================================================================
PLANNING SUMMARY
================================================================================

APPROACH:

Phase 1: Analyze Existing Visualizations
- Review chart implementations from reference projects
- Document current typography usage patterns
- Analyze layout and spacing systems in use
- Extract color palettes and usage patterns
- Identify inconsistencies to be standardized

Phase 2: Research Industry Standards
- Study design systems: Material Design, Carbon, Ant Design
- Research chart.js and Recharts best practices
- Review accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1)
- Benchmark with industry-leading dashboards
- Identify gaps and improvement opportunities

Phase 3: Define CBO Standards
- Chart types: Line, Bar, Donut, Stacked, Mixed, Sankey
- Chart configurations: colors, tooltips, legends, labels
- Typography: font families, sizes, weights, line heights
- Layout: spacing scale, grid systems, breakpoints
- Colors: primary palette, status colors, chart colors
- Responsive behavior rules

Phase 4: Create Documentation
- Write comprehensive visualization standards
- Include visual examples and code snippets
- Create chart configuration templates
- Document typography scale and usage
- Provide layout examples and guidelines

RESOURCES NEEDED:
- Access to reference project visualizations
- Design tools (Figma/Sketch) for mockups
- Chart libraries documentation (Chart.js, Recharts)
- Design system references
- Review from Design Lead (if available)
- Approval from 2 senior developers

DELIVERABLES:
1. CBO_VISUALIZATION_STANDARDS.md documentation containing:
   - Chart standards for each type
   - Chart configuration templates
   - Typography system specification
   - Layout and spacing guidelines
   - Color palette with usage rules
   - Responsive design standards
   - Accessibility guidelines
   - Code examples and snippets

2. Supporting artifacts:
   - Chart configuration templates (JSON/objects)
   - Typography specimen sheet
   - Color palette reference
   - Layout grid examples
   - Quick reference cards

DEPENDENCIES:
- Sub-Task 1 completed (framework standards)
- Access to reference project codebase
- Stakeholder availability for review

RISKS & MITIGATION:

Risk 1: Standards too rigid, limiting design flexibility
Mitigation: Define core standards with flexibility for edge cases, 
document when deviations are acceptable

Risk 2: Chart library limitations prevent standardization
Mitigation: Research multiple chart solutions, choose most flexible 
libraries, document workarounds

Risk 3: Accessibility requirements conflict with design aesthetics
Mitigation: Prioritize accessibility, find creative solutions that 
meet both requirements

Risk 4: Color palette doesn't work for all use cases
Mitigation: Create base palette with extension guidelines, allow 
contextual color variations with approval
