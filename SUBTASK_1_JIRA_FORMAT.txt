SUB-TASK 1: DEFINE UNIFIED FRONTEND FRAMEWORK & COMPONENT RULES
================================================================================

Epic: Frontend Visualization Standardization v1.0.0
Department: CBO
Date Created: October 25, 2025
Assignee: [TO BE ASSIGNED]
Status: To Do

================================================================================
TASK DESCRIPTION
================================================================================

OBJECTIVE:
Establish a standardized HTML/Dashboard frontend framework structure and 
component usage rules, including page hierarchy, module naming, component 
reuse logic, and file organization.

BACKGROUND:
CBO Department needs a universal standard for building dashboard applications. 
Currently, there are various patterns and practices from existing projects 
that can be extracted, evaluated, and generalized for department-wide use. 
This task will document framework standards to ensure all developers follow 
the same structure and naming conventions when creating or modifying pages.

SCOPE:
This task covers:
- Page hierarchy and structure standards
- Component naming conventions
- File organization guidelines  
- Component reuse logic and patterns
- Code structure best practices

Out of Scope:
- Styling/visualization standards (Sub-Task 2)
- Implementation of new components (Sub-Task 3)
- XOO integration (Sub-Task 4)

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
1. Framework documentation completed with clear guidelines
2. Page hierarchy standards defined
3. Naming conventions documented with examples
4. File organization rules established
5. Component reuse logic documented
6. Reviewed and approved by minimum 2 team members

DEFINITION OF DONE:
- Comprehensive documentation created covering all areas
- Includes code examples and practical guidelines
- Reviewed by 2 senior developers
- Approved by Tech Lead
- Ready for team-wide implementation

================================================================================
PLANNING SUMMARY
================================================================================

APPROACH:

Phase 1: Extract from Project Reference
- Scan reference project codebase structure (app/, components/, lib/, utils/)
- Analyze existing component hierarchy patterns
- Document current naming conventions
- Extract file organization logic
- Identify reusable and proven patterns

Phase 2: Identify Reusable Patterns
- Component categories: Layout, KPI Cards, Charts, Slicers, Modals
- Page structure patterns: 3-row minimum (KPI + Chart + Chart)
- API route patterns: /api/{category}-{feature}/{endpoint}
- Helper organization: lib/ vs utils/ separation

Phase 3: Generalize for CBO Department
- Remove project-specific logic (e.g. specific categories → Multi-category pattern)
- Convert domain-specific to generic patterns
- Create generic templates applicable to any dashboard type
- Define clear extensibility rules

Phase 4: Create Documentation
- Write comprehensive markdown documentation
- Include code examples and best practices
- Create migration checklist
- Add glossary and references

RESOURCES NEEDED:
- Access to reference project codebase (full access)
- Documentation platform (Confluence/Markdown) ✓
- Review session with development team
- Approval from 2 senior developers
- Tech Lead sign-off

DELIVERABLES:
1. CBO_FRONTEND_FRAMEWORK_STANDARD.md documentation file containing:
   - Project structure standards
   - Page hierarchy guidelines
   - Component architecture documentation
   - Naming conventions (files, components, variables)
   - File organization rules
   - Layout system patterns
   - Component usage standards
   - API architecture patterns
   - Best practices and guidelines
   - Migration checklist
   - Code examples

2. Supporting artifacts:
   - Component catalog (all components documented)
   - API patterns guide (standard endpoints)
   - Format helpers reference
   - Quick reference guide

DEPENDENCIES:
- Access to reference project codebase
- Stakeholder availability for review sessions
- No blocking dependencies from other sub-tasks

RISKS & MITIGATION:

Risk 1: Documentation too project-specific, not reusable
Mitigation: Create generic templates, remove domain-specific logic, 
focus on framework patterns not business logic

Risk 2: Insufficient stakeholder input
Mitigation: Schedule dedicated review sessions, involve senior developers 
early in the process

Risk 3: Standards too rigid, limiting creativity
Mitigation: Define standards for consistency while allowing flexibility 
where appropriate, document when to deviate

Risk 4: Documentation becomes outdated quickly
Mitigation: Implement version control, establish update process, assign 
documentation owner

Challenges Encountered:

1. CHALLENGE: Balance Domain-Specific vs Generic Patterns
   - Reference project has business logic specific to certain domain
   - Risk: Documentation too domain-specific, limiting reusability
   - Impact: Pattern extraction requires careful balance between specific examples & generic applicability
   - Consideration: How to make patterns adaptable for various dashboard types

2. CHALLENGE: Inconsistency in Existing Patterns
   - Found several inconsistencies in reference implementation:
     * Component naming not uniform (some use prefixes, some don't)
     * API route patterns mixed (camelCase vs kebab-case)
     * File organization varies (some features split, some combined)
   - Impact: Requires judgment calls for "what should be standard"
   - Decision: Choose most scalable & maintainable patterns

3. CHALLENGE: Documentation Depth vs Accessibility
   - Comprehensive documentation (1,404 lines) vs easy-to-digest format
   - Risk: Too detailed → developers skip reading, too simple → insufficient guidance
   - Balance needed: Between thoroughness & usability
   - Consideration: Different audiences (senior devs vs juniors) need different depth levels

4. CHALLENGE: Framework & Technology Agnostic Standards
   - Reference project uses specific tech stack (Next.js, Supabase, Recharts, etc.)
   - Not all future CBO projects will use identical stack
   - Need: Core patterns that work across different frameworks/libraries
   - Solution required: Separate universal patterns from tech-specific implementations

Solutions Applied:

1. SOLUTION for Challenge 1: Generic Pattern Extraction (80% + 20% approach)
   ✅ Removed all business-specific terminology & references
   ✅ Replaced with generic placeholders: {category}, {feature}, {metric}
   ✅ Focused on framework patterns, not domain-specific logic
   ✅ Provided "Adaptation Guide" section for different business contexts
   ✅ Examples written in dual format: generic patterns + concrete examples
   ✅ Documented extensibility points for custom business logic

2. SOLUTION for Challenge 2: Define Clear Standard Hierarchy
   ✅ Created priority-based standards:
      • Priority 1 (MUST): Framework-level patterns (structure, organization)
      • Priority 2 (SHOULD): Component-level patterns (naming, props)
      • Priority 3 (CAN): Styling patterns (colors, spacing - customizable)
   ✅ Documented "When to Deviate" guidelines for edge cases
   ✅ Provided cleanup recommendations for inconsistencies
   ✅ Established versioning system for future standard updates

3. SOLUTION for Challenge 3: Layered Documentation Strategy
   ✅ Multi-level documentation approach:
      • Quick Reference section (1-page cheatsheet)
      • Section summaries (TL;DR at start of each section)
      • Detailed explanations (for deep understanding)
      • Code examples (learn by doing)
   ✅ Separate Migration Checklist for quick adoption
   ✅ Visual hierarchy for easy navigation
   ✅ Searchable structure with clear table of contents

4. SOLUTION for Challenge 4: Framework-Agnostic Core
   ✅ Two-layer documentation structure:
      • Layer 1: Universal patterns (applicable to any framework/library)
      • Layer 2: Implementation-specific notes (e.g., Next.js specifics)
   ✅ Clear "Framework Requirements" callouts in each section
   ✅ Alternative approaches provided for different tech stacks
   ✅ Abstract interfaces defined (Chart Interface, Data Layer, etc.)
   ✅ Separation of concerns: Structure vs Implementation

LESSONS LEARNED:

Positive:
✅ Reference Project Quality Significantly Impacts Results
   - Well-structured reference project accelerated pattern extraction
   - Clear separation of concerns (app/, components/, lib/, utils/) made identification easy
   - Mostly consistent naming reduced ambiguity
   - Learning: Always choose production-ready, well-maintained project as reference

✅ Layered Documentation Approach Works
   - Quick Reference + Detailed Sections + Code Examples = optimal for different learning styles
   - Developers can choose depth of dive based on need
   - Examples speak louder than words - code snippets highly valuable
   - Learning: Documentation should be multi-layered for maximum utility

✅ Early & Frequent Reviews
   - Mid-sprint review (day 4) caught major gaps early
   - Multiple reviewers (Senior + Mid-level) provided balanced perspective
   - Incremental feedback easier to incorporate than bulk feedback at end
   - Learning: Review early, review often, diverse reviewers

✅ Generic + Specific Examples Balance
   - Providing both placeholder patterns AND concrete examples increased understanding
   - Generic patterns for reusability, specific examples for clarity
   - This dual approach reduced "how do I apply this?" questions
   - Learning: Abstract concepts need concrete examples

✅ Version Control for Documentation
   - Git for documentation provided clear change history
   - Easy to roll back bad changes
   - Collaboration via pull requests worked well
   - Learning: Treat documentation like code - version control everything

Challenges:
❌ Balancing Depth vs Brevity
   - 1,404 lines might be too much for quick reference
   - Some developers prefer "show me example" over "tell me theory"
   - Risk: Comprehensive documentation not read because too long
   - Area for Improvement: Consider splitting into multiple focused documents

❌ Technology Stack Specificity
   - Reference project used Next.js 14, Supabase, Recharts
   - Not all CBO projects use same stack
   - Had to add "Framework Requirements" sections to address this
   - Area for Improvement: Create stack-specific guides as supplements

❌ Inconsistency in Reference Project
   - Found various naming inconsistencies (StandardChart, standard-chart, etc.)
   - Had to make judgment calls on "what should be standard"
   - Some patterns not fully proven (used in only 1-2 places)
   - Area for Improvement: Cleanup reference project first before extracting standards

❌ Limited Real-World Testing
   - Documentation based on theoretical extraction
   - Not yet tested in brand new project from scratch
   - Unknown issues may surface during actual adoption
   - Area for Improvement: Pilot test with new project before wide rollout
