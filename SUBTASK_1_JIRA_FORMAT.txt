SUB-TASK 1: DEFINE UNIFIED FRONTEND FRAMEWORK & COMPONENT RULES
================================================================================

Epic: Frontend Visualization Standardization v1.0.0
Department: CBO
Date Created: October 25, 2025
Assignee: [TO BE ASSIGNED]
Status: To Do

================================================================================
TASK DESCRIPTION
================================================================================

OBJECTIVE:
Establish a standardized HTML/Dashboard frontend framework structure and 
component usage rules, including page hierarchy, module naming, component 
reuse logic, and file organization.

BACKGROUND:
CBO Department needs a universal standard for building dashboard applications. 
Currently, there are various patterns and practices from existing projects 
that can be extracted, evaluated, and generalized for department-wide use. 
This task will document framework standards to ensure all developers follow 
the same structure and naming conventions when creating or modifying pages.

SCOPE:
This task covers:
- Page hierarchy and structure standards
- Component naming conventions
- File organization guidelines  
- Component reuse logic and patterns
- Code structure best practices

Out of Scope:
- Styling/visualization standards (Sub-Task 2)
- Implementation of new components (Sub-Task 3)
- XOO integration (Sub-Task 4)

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
1. Framework documentation completed with clear guidelines
2. Page hierarchy standards defined
3. Naming conventions documented with examples
4. File organization rules established
5. Component reuse logic documented
6. Reviewed and approved by minimum 2 team members

DEFINITION OF DONE:
- Comprehensive documentation created covering all areas
- Includes code examples and practical guidelines
- Reviewed by 2 senior developers
- Approved by Tech Lead
- Ready for team-wide implementation

================================================================================
PLANNING SUMMARY
================================================================================

APPROACH:

Phase 1: Extract from Project Reference
- Scan reference project codebase structure (app/, components/, lib/, utils/)
- Analyze existing component hierarchy patterns
- Document current naming conventions
- Extract file organization logic
- Identify reusable and proven patterns

Phase 2: Identify Reusable Patterns
- Component categories: Layout, KPI Cards, Charts, Slicers, Modals
- Page structure patterns: 3-row minimum (KPI + Chart + Chart)
- API route patterns: /api/{category}-{feature}/{endpoint}
- Helper organization: lib/ vs utils/ separation

Phase 3: Generalize for CBO Department
- Remove project-specific logic (e.g. specific categories → Multi-category pattern)
- Convert domain-specific to generic patterns
- Create generic templates applicable to any dashboard type
- Define clear extensibility rules

Phase 4: Create Documentation
- Write comprehensive markdown documentation
- Include code examples and best practices
- Create migration checklist
- Add glossary and references

RESOURCES NEEDED:
- Access to reference project codebase (full access)
- Documentation platform (Confluence/Markdown) ✓
- Review session with development team
- Approval from 2 senior developers
- Tech Lead sign-off

DELIVERABLES:
1. CBO_FRONTEND_FRAMEWORK_STANDARD.md documentation file containing:
   - Project structure standards
   - Page hierarchy guidelines
   - Component architecture documentation
   - Naming conventions (files, components, variables)
   - File organization rules
   - Layout system patterns
   - Component usage standards
   - API architecture patterns
   - Best practices and guidelines
   - Migration checklist
   - Code examples

2. Supporting artifacts:
   - Component catalog (all components documented)
   - API patterns guide (standard endpoints)
   - Format helpers reference
   - Quick reference guide

DEPENDENCIES:
- Access to reference project codebase
- Stakeholder availability for review sessions
- No blocking dependencies from other sub-tasks

RISKS & MITIGATION:

Risk 1: Documentation too project-specific, not reusable
Mitigation: Create generic templates, remove domain-specific logic, 
focus on framework patterns not business logic

Risk 2: Insufficient stakeholder input
Mitigation: Schedule dedicated review sessions, involve senior developers 
early in the process

Risk 3: Standards too rigid, limiting creativity
Mitigation: Define standards for consistency while allowing flexibility 
where appropriate, document when to deviate

Risk 4: Documentation becomes outdated quickly
Mitigation: Implement version control, establish update process, assign 
documentation owner
