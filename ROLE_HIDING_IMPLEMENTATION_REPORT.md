# 🔒 ROLE-BASED PAGE HIDING - IMPLEMENTATION REPORT

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**  
**Type:** Access Control Update  

---

## 📊 IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

### **Pages Hidden:**

3 pages per currency (SGD & USC) = **6 pages total** hidden

**SGD Pages:**

---

### **Roles Affected:**

**5 roles** will NOT see these pages in sidebar:

| Role | Hidden SGD Pages | Hidden USC Pages | Reason |
|------|-----------------|------------------|--------|
| `executive` | 3 pages | 3 pages | Still in development |
| `manager_sgd` | 3 pages | - | SGD-specific restriction |
| `manager_usc` | - | 3 pages | USC-specific restriction |
| `sq_sgd` | 3 pages | - | SGD-specific restriction |
| `sq_usc` | - | 3 pages | USC-specific restriction |

**Admin role:** ✅ Can see ALL pages (no restrictions)

---

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### **File Modified:**
```
📄 components/Sidebar.tsx (lines 24-73)
```

### **Changes Made:**

#### **1. Extended filterMenuItemsByRole Function:**

**Before:**
```typescript
// Only handled MYR pages
const hiddenPagesForMYRRoles = [...]
if (userRole === 'manager_myr' || userRole === 'sq_myr') {
  // filter MYR pages only
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Now handles MYR, SGD, and USC pages
const hiddenPagesForMYRRoles = ['/myr/overview', '/myr/member-analytic', '/myr/churn-member']
const hiddenPagesForSGDRoles = ['/sgd/overview', '/sgd/member-analytic', '/sgd/churn-member']
const hiddenPagesForUSCRoles = ['/usc/overview', '/usc/member-analytic', '/usc/churn-member']

// Filter SGD pages
if (userRole === 'manager_sgd' || userRole === 'sq_sgd' || userRole === 'executive') {
  // filter SGD submenu
}

// Filter USC pages
if (userRole === 'manager_usc' || userRole === 'sq_usc' || userRole === 'executive') {
  // filter USC submenu
}
```

#### **2. Added Brand Performance Trends to Menus:**

**SGD Menu (line 294):**
```typescript
submenu: [
  { title: 'Overview', path: '/sgd/overview' },
  { title: 'Member Analytic', path: '/sgd/member-analytic' },
  { title: 'Brand Performance Trends', path: '/sgd/brand-performance-trends' }, // ✅ NEW
  { title: 'Brand Comparison', path: '/sgd/brand-comparison' },
  // ... rest
]
```

**USC Menu (line 309):**
```typescript
submenu: [
  { title: 'Overview', path: '/usc/overview' },
  { title: 'Member Analytic', path: '/usc/member-analytic' },
  { title: 'Brand Performance Trends', path: '/usc/brand-performance-trends' }, // ✅ NEW
  { title: 'Brand Comparison', path: '/usc/brand-comparison' },
  // ... rest
]
```

## ✅ VERIFICATION

### **Test Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Login as `executive`**
```
Expected SGD Menu:
- Brand Performance Trends ✅
- Brand Comparison ✅
- KPI Comparison ✅
- Customer Retention ✅
- Member Report ✅

Hidden:
- Overview ❌
- Member Analytic ❌
- Churn Member ❌
```

**Scenario 2: Login as `manager_sgd`**
```
Expected SGD Menu: (same as executive)
- Brand Performance Trends ✅
- Brand Comparison ✅
- KPI Comparison ✅
- Customer Retention ✅
- Member Report ✅

Hidden:
- Overview ❌
- Member Analytic ❌
- Churn Member ❌
```

**Scenario 3: Login as `manager_usc`**
```
Expected USC Menu:
- Brand Performance Trends ✅
- Brand Comparison ✅
- KPI Comparison ✅
- Customer Retention ✅
- Member Report ✅

Hidden:
- Overview ❌
- Member Analytic ❌
- Churn Member ❌
```

**Scenario 4: Login as `admin`**
```
Expected: ALL pages visible (no restrictions)
```

## 🔐 ACCESS CONTROL LOGIC

### **How It Works:**

```typescript
// 1. Admin bypasses all filters
if (userRole === 'admin') {
  return menuItems // Show everything
}

// 2. Check role and apply appropriate filters
if (userRole === 'executive' || userRole === 'manager_sgd' || userRole === 'sq_sgd') {
  // Hide SGD: Overview, Member Analytic, Churn Member
}

if (userRole === 'executive' || userRole === 'manager_usc' || userRole === 'sq_usc') {
  // Hide USC: Overview, Member Analytic, Churn Member
}

// 3. Return filtered menu
```

### **Why Executive is Affected:**

Executive has access to MYR, SGD, and USC. Since these pages are "still in development" for SGD/USC, they're hidden from executive too to avoid confusion or incomplete features.

## 📁 FILES MODIFIED

| File | Changes | Lines Modified |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `components/Sidebar.tsx` | Extended filtering logic | ~50 lines |
| - | Added Brand Performance Trends to SGD menu | 1 line |
| - | Added Brand Performance Trends to USC menu | 1 line |

---

## 🎯 BUSINESS LOGIC

### **Pages Hidden = Pages Not Ready**

The hidden pages represent features that are:
- ⚠️ Still in development
- ⚠️ Not yet production-ready
- ⚠️ Should not be visible to non-admin users

### **Pages Visible = Production Ready**

The visible pages are:
- ✅ Fully implemented
- ✅ Tested and stable
- ✅ Safe for all users to access

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### **1. Direct URL Access:**

Users can still access hidden pages via direct URL:
```
http://localhost:3000/sgd/overview
http://localhost:3000/usc/member-analytic
```

**If you want to block direct access too:**
- Need to add middleware or page-level access control
- Current implementation: Only hides from sidebar menu

### **2. Admin Override:**

Admin users will see ALL pages including hidden ones.
This is intentional for testing and management purposes.

### **3. MYR Pages:**

MYR pages also have same restrictions for `manager_myr` and `sq_myr` (already implemented before).

---

## 🧪 TESTING CHECKLIST

### **Test as Different Roles:**

- [ ] Login as `admin` → Should see ALL pages
- [ ] Login as `executive` → Should NOT see Overview, Member Analytic, Churn Member (SGD & USC)
- [ ] Login as `manager_sgd` → Should NOT see Overview, Member Analytic, Churn Member (SGD only)
- [ ] Login as `manager_usc` → Should NOT see Overview, Member Analytic, Churn Member (USC only)
- [ ] Login as `sq_sgd` → Should NOT see Overview, Member Analytic, Churn Member (SGD only)
- [ ] Login as `sq_usc` → Should NOT see Overview, Member Analytic, Churn Member (USC only)

### **Verify Menu Items:**

- [ ] Brand Performance Trends appears in SGD menu
- [ ] Brand Performance Trends appears in USC menu
- [ ] Hidden pages don't appear in sidebar for restricted roles
- [ ] Other pages still visible and working

## 📊 IMPACT ANALYSIS

### **Before:**
```
Executive → Sees ALL SGD/USC pages (including unfinished ones)
Manager SGD → Sees ALL SGD pages (including unfinished ones)
Manager USC → Sees ALL USC pages (including unfinished ones)
SQ roles → See ALL pages (including unfinished ones)
```

### **After:**
```
Executive → Sees ONLY ready SGD/USC pages ✅
Manager SGD → Sees ONLY ready SGD pages ✅
Manager USC → Sees ONLY ready USC pages ✅
SQ roles → See ONLY ready pages ✅
Admin → Still sees EVERYTHING ✅
```

### **Benefits:**
- ✅ Cleaner UI for non-admin users
- ✅ No confusion about incomplete features
- ✅ Better user experience
- ✅ Admin retains full access for management

---

## ✅ COMPLETION STATUS

**Implementation:** ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Testing Required:** ⚠️ **YES** (test different role logins)  
**Risk Level:** 🟢 **LOW** (only UI filtering)  
**Rollback:** ✅ **Easy** (restore Sidebar.tsx from backup)
